# Fitnessx-appointment-app
An app I created which catered for meal plan, location and fitness appointment.

1.First off, you require Visual studio code with these updates to run this app:

Version: 1.64.2 (user setup)
Commit: f80445acd5a3dadef24aa209168452a3d97cc326
Date: 2022-02-09T22:02:28.252Z
Electron: 13.5.2
Chromium: 91.0.4472.164
Node.js: 14.16.0
V8: 9.1.269.39-electron.0
OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.19044

2.You will need to install mongoose for the api ti function.

3.You will need to install mongod (mongo db) becasue it connected a database seperately to work


The following steps are what you require to actually boot the app and get it running.

In the terminal view of visual studio code:

1. cd into the api folder = cd api

2. npm start

3.run mongo db too and create database to exact specification n code if it hasnt been done already

then also run your angular app. The ports have already been preconfgured so you dont have to touch it.

A browser will then appear.
